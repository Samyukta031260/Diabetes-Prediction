# 🩺 Diabetes Prediction using Machine Learning

## 📌 Project Overview
This project predicts whether a patient is diabetic or non-diabetic using Machine Learning techniques based on medical parameters such as glucose level, BMI, insulin level, and age.

## 🎯 Objective
To build a predictive healthcare model that can assist in early detection of diabetes using data-driven analysis.

## 🧠 Algorithm Used
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Python
- Google Colab
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-Learn
- Matplotlib

## 📊 Model Performance
The trained SVM model was able to classify diabetic and non-diabetic patients with good accuracy using the PIMA Diabetes Dataset.

## 📁 Dataset
PIMA Indians Diabetes Dataset
